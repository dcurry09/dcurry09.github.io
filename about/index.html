<div class="blurb">

<p> Becoming a Data Scientist: for last 3 years I've been living and working at CERN(European Center for Particle Physics) in Geneva, SwitzerIand. During this time I analyzed petabytes of data and used machine learning(BDTs, neural networks, optimization), 
    data filtering, and statistical inference to help find evidence for a new Higgs Boson decay.

I feel satisfied with what I achieved in my physics career and now I have turned to applying what I have learned in the academic world to the world of business and technology.</a></p>
