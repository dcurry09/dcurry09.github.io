title: About David Curry

<div class="blurb">

<p> Since the time of my youth I've been inquiring into the nature of the world around me.  I've been thrown out of church, ran out of town, and rapped on
    the knuckles for these inquiries.  Years later I formalized these questions into a study of particle physics and for last 3 years I've been living and working at CERN(European Center for Particle Physics) in 
    Geneva, Switzerland. During this time I analyzed petabytes of data and used machine learning(BDTs, neural networks, optimization), 
    data filtering, and statistical inference to help find evidence for a new Higgs Boson decay.

<p>I feel satisfied with what I have learned achieved in my physics career and now I have turned to applying what I have learned in the academic world to the world of technology and art.</a></p>
